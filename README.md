# Turbo

in [977](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/issues/977) in the upstream of Turbo, I said

> While open source work should have strong opinions and governance, once other contributors become involved those opinions cease to be the property of a sole individual and deserve proper discussion.

I was wrong, wrong, and don't understand [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft)-[politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs).

My complaint would be reasonable for Free and Open Source - GPL, software. Where the **power and responsibility** belongs to everyone contributing. However, Open Source - MIT, software, is not digital communism, democracy, or any form of government, it's anarchy. Anarchy assigns power based on a single metric: **strength in reality**. He owns that repo. He does not need to share with me. It's his toy. All GitHub repos have, like subreddits or discord servers, rules, morals, and administration, in self-governance. GitHub is not a blockchain(-like) community-_anything_. It all depends on the morals of an individual GitHub repo. @dhh is a dictator, and [dictatorship can work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtkI-QAgM6w) too.

Turbo uses complementary techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of custom JavaScript that most web applications will need to write:

* Turbo Drive accelerates links and form submissions by negating the need for full page reloads.
* Turbo Frames decompose pages into independent contexts, which scope navigation and can be lazily loaded.
* Turbo Streams deliver page changes over WebSocket or in response to form submissions using just HTML and a set of CRUD-like actions.
* Turbo Native lets your majestic monolith form the center of your native iOS and Android apps, with seamless transitions between web and native sections.

It's all done by sending HTML over the wire. And for those instances when that's not enough, you can reach for the other side of Hotwire, and finish the job with [Stimulus](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus).
